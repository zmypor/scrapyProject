### Project Introduction

**This project uses the Scrapy framework to crawl the ancient poetry and literature website (http://so.gushiwen.cn), obtaining the titles, authors, annotations, and creative backgrounds of all words in different categories (such as nostalgia, love, friendship, etc.) on the recommended webpages. In addition, this project provides code and organized data for grouping words of different categories together (not by category). For example, please refer to the following figureï¼š
