                                                            Project Introduction
This project uses the Scrapy framework to crawl the ancient poetry and literature website, obtaining the titles, authors, annotations, and creative backgrounds of all words in different categories 
(such as nostalgia, love, friendship, etc.) on the recommended pages of the website.
